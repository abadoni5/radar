        Automotive radars are designed for use in advanced driver-assistance
        systems (ADAS) like collision avoidance, adaptive cruise control, blind
        spot detection, etc. By operating in the W-band, these radars can
        provide detailed information about the vehicle's immediate surroundings,
        allowing for precise detection and tracking of objects, such as other
        vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles.
